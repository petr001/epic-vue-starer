# Epic Vue starter

This starter is based on awesome `@vue/cli` and uses it's `serve` functionality. Therefore it's super-simple, yet full-featured.

* You can quickly prototype new app with preconfigured `vue-router`
* `yarn start` simply runs `vue serve index.js` and starts live-reload development server
* `yarn build` simply runs `vue build index.js` and creates production ready build

## Prerequisites

Install globally `@vue/cli` and `@vue/cli-service-global`:

```
yarn global add @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global
```
